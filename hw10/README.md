Future assignments will build off of the code in this assignment to implement two more data structures called AVL trees and heaps.

**Due date:**
8 April 

**Learning Objectives:**

1. understand basic object oriented programming
1. understand the binary search tree data structure
1. practice creating larger python projects with multiple files

## Tasks

Complete the following tasks:

1. Fork the [trees repo](https://github.com/mikeizbicki/trees) and enable travis
1. Update the `README.md` file so that the travis button points to your repo
1. Implement every function in the `BinaryTree` and `BST` classes so that all test cases pass.

Your grade will be the percentage of test cases that successfully pass in travis.

## Submission

Submit the link to your forked repository on sakai.
