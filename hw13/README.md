# Trees (4) - putting it all together

You will create a pypi package containing all of your code from your `tree` repo.

**Due date:**
Tuesday, 5 May at midnight

**Learning Objectives:**

1. understand package management systems
1. create a real python package that anyone in the world can download

## Background

The [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/) is a central repository for all python software.
Whenever you run a command like
```
$ pip3 install XXX
```
your computer downloads the `XXX` package from pypi. 

## Tasks

Complete the following tasks:

1. Merge your `avl` and `heap` branches into your `master` branch.

1. Create a file called `LICENSE` containing the GPLv3 license agreement.
    You can find a copy of the GPLv3 at https://choosealicense.com/ .

1. Follow [this tutorial](https://realpython.com/pypi-publish-python-package/#preparing-your-package-for-publication) in order to create a `setup.py` file and upload your project to pypi.
    You must update the configuration settings correctly, and you must choose a project name that begins with `cs46_`.

## Submission

Submit the link to your project on pypi into sakai.

## Collaboration Policy

All forms of collaboration with other students are encouraged.
Please only look at another student's github repo if you are collaborating with them.
Remember that you are responsible for ensuring that you understand the material.
