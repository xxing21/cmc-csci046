# Learning the open source workflow

**Learning Objectives:**

1. learn how to work on a remote unix server
1. learn how to use the git version control system
1. learn how to use travis-ci to automatically verify that your projects work

<!--
## Background

Version control systems are widely used in industry and in open source projects.
They are the tool that lets many programmers work together on complex software.
I don't know what programming language you will use at your future job (it may not even exist yet!),
but I guarantee you will be using version control.
Currently, git is the most popular version control system and we will use git in this course for all your software projects.

Git is an example of a UNIX command line tool.
UNIX is a family of operating systems that are widely popular.
MacOS and Linux are the two most commonly used UNIX operating systems,
but there are many other examples.
In particular, Windows is not a UNIX operating system.
