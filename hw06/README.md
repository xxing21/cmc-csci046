# Binary Search

You will implement several variations of the binary search algorithm.

**Due date:**
Sunday, March 8 by midnight
(you may suggest an alternative due date by submitting a pull request;
I will not accept the pull request unless you have completed 2 of the 3 required functions)

**Learning Objectives:**

1. understand the binary search algorithm
1. practice recursion
1. practice using the github/travis toolchain

## Tasks

Complete the following tasks:

1. Fork the [binary\_search repo](https://github.com/mikeizbicki/binary_search) and enable travis
1. Update the `README.md` file so that the travis button points to your repo
1. Implement the `find_smallest_positive`, `count_repeats`, `argmin` functions so that all test cases in `tests/test_main.py` pass.
   You must implement each function recursively, and you must ensure that they have logarithmic runtime.

Your grade will be the percentage of test cases that successfully pass in travis.

## Submission

Submit the link to your forked repository on sakai.

## Collaboration Policy

**You are not allowed to look at another student's github repo.**

All other forms of collaboration with other students are encouraged.
You may use any other online resources you like to complete this assignment.
