# Graph Traversals

Graphs are one of the key unifying concepts in computer science.
Most problems can be solved by:
1. convert the problem into the language of graphs, and then
2. use an appropriate graph algorithm.
All of your previous homework problems actually follow this pattern,
and 99% of all artificial intelligence fits this pattern.

We will cover three graph algorithms in this lecture:

| Algorithm | Data Structure | Run Time |
| --------- | -------------- | -------- |
| Depth First Search (DFS) | Stack | O(V + E) |
| Bread First Search (BFS) | Queue | O(V + E) |
| Dijkstra's Algorithm (shortest path) | Priority Queue (Heap) | O( (V + E) log V) |
